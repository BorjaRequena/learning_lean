# Learning LEAN

[LEAN](https://lean-lang.org) is a programming langugae for formal math.

One of its major applications is theorem proving through formally verified code, which makes it a prominent tool for research in the field of mathematics.
For example, the author of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05328) found a subtle error in the original derivation while formalizing it in LEAN4 (the code is accessible [in this repository](https://github.com/teorth/symmetric_project)), which allowed it to be corrected in a subsequent version of the manuscript.
Additionally, LEAN has proven to be an extremely valuable tool to develop automated theorem proving systems, such as [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/) or [DeepSeek prover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21801).

In this repository, I document my LEAN4-learning journey as I work my way through the [mathematics in lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) tutorial and the [natural number game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4).
